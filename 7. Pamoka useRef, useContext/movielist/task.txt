Create a simple app that displays a list of movies and allows the user to add movies to their favorites list.
Use useContext to share the favorites list between two components.


1. Create a MovieList component that renders a list of movies.
   Each movie should have a button that adds it to the favorites list.
   Use useState to keep track of the favorites list.
	
	
2. Create a FavoritesList component that displays the movies in the favorites list.
   Use useContext to share the favorites list between the MovieList and FavoritesList components.
	
	
3. Wrap both components with a FavoritesContext that provides the favorites list using useContext.
	
	
4. Test the app by adding some movies to the favorites list and making sure they are displayed correctly in the FavoritesList component.
