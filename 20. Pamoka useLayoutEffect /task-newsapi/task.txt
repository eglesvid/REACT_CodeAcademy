Task: Building a News Portal Application using React, React Router, and useEffect

Objective: In this task, you will practice your React, React Router, and useEffect
skills by creating a news portal application that allows users to browse through
different news categories and view articles.

Requirements:
1. Set up a new React project using create-react-app.
2. Use a public news API, such as NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/),
   to fetch news articles for different categories
   (e.g., technology, sports, entertainment, etc.).
3. Create a navigation bar with links to different news categories.
   Use React Router to set up routes for each category.
4. Create a Category component that will display a list of articles for the selected category.
   The component should use the useEffect hook to fetch the articles for the given
   category whenever the category changes.
5. Create an Article component that will display the article's title, image, description,
   and a link to read the full article on its original source.
6. Use CSS or styled-components(Optional).
7. Add pagination or infinite scrolling to load more articles as the user scrolls down.
