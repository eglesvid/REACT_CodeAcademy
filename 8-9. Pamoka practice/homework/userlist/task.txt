Task:

1. Create a new React component called UserList that will display a list of users.
	
2. Inside the UserList component, declare a new state variable called users using the useState hook. Initialize it as an empty array.
	
3. Inside the UserList component, declare a new state variable called isLoading using the useState hook. Initialize it as true.
	
4. Inside the UserList component, declare a new state variable called error using the useState hook. Initialize it as null.
	
5. Inside the UserList component, use the useEffect hook to fetch a list of users from the following API endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
	
6. While the data is being fetched, set the isLoading state variable to true.
	
7. If an error occurs while fetching the data, set the error state variable to the error message and set the isLoading state variable to false.
	
8. If the data is successfully fetched, set the users state variable to the fetched data and set the isLoading state variable to false.
	
9. Render the users in an unordered list (<ul>), displaying their name, email, and company properties.
	
10. If isLoading is true, display a message indicating that the data is being fetched.
	
11. If error is not null, display an error message instead of the list of users.
