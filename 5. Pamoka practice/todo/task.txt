The application should have the following components:
1. App: This should be the top-level component that manages the state of the tasks list. It should contain the Header and TaskList components as children.
2. Header: This should be a simple component that displays a title for the the application.
3. TaskList: This should be a component that displays a list of all the tasks. It should receive the list of tasks as a prop and render each task as a Task component.
4. Task: This should be a component that displays a single task.
        It should receive the task details as props, including the task text and whether or not it is completed.
        The component should display the task text in black if the task is not completed and gray if it is completed.
        It should also display a checkbox that toggles the completion state of the task.
5. AddTaskForm: This should be a component that allows the user to add a new task to the list.
                It should have a text input field and a "Add Task" button.
                When the user clicks the button, the new task should be added to the list and displayed in the TaskList component.

To implement this you will need to:
1. Create the App component and use the useState hook to manage the list of tasks.
2. Create the Header component and render it in the App component.
3. Create the TaskList component and render it in the App component. Pass the list tasks as a prop to this component.
4. Create the Task component and render it in the TaskList component for each task in the list. Pass the task details as props to this component.
5. Implement the checkbox in the Task component using the useState hook to manage the completion state of the task.
6. Create the AddTaskForm component and render it in the App component.
Implement the logic to add a new task to the list when the "Add Task" button is clicked.
