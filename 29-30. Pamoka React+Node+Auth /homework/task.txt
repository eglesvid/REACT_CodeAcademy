In this task, you will practice your Node.js, Express, and MongoDB skills by
creating a basic Blog API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on blog posts.
The API should support creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.


Requirements:
1. Set up the project:
   a. Initialize a new Node.js project.
   b. Install the necessary dependencies (Express, mongoose, dotenv).
	
2. Connect to a MongoDB database using mongoose driver.

3. Create a schema and model for blog posts using the following structure:
	
4. {
	  title: <String>,
	  content: <String>,
	  author: <String>,
	  createdAt: <Date>,
	  updatedAt: <Date>
	}

5. Implement the following endpoints:
   a. GET /api/posts: Retrieve all blog posts.

6. b. GET /api/posts/:id: Retrieve a single blog post by ID.

7. c. POST /api/posts: Create a new blog post.

8. d. PUT /api/posts/:id: Update an existing blog post by ID.

9. e. DELETE /api/posts/:id: Delete a blog post by ID.

10. Add appropriate error handling for cases
   when the provided ID is not found,
   when there is invalid input,
   or when there is a problem with the database connection.
