Objective:
Create a custom hook called useMouseCoordinates that will help manage
the current mouse coordinates (x, y) on the screen.
This custom hook will handle the mouse coordinates' state and update them when the mouse moves.

Requirements:
1. The custom hook should return an object containing the current x and y coordinates of the mouse.
2. The custom hook should update the x and y coordinates when the mouse moves.
3. The custom hook should clean up the event listener when the component using the hook is unmounted.
