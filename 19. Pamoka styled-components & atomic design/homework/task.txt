Task: Create a React component that displays a list of items with a custom style

Requirements:
1. Create a React functional component called ItemList that receives an array of items as a prop.
2. Use styled components to create a custom style for the component.
3. The component should display the list of items as an unordered list (<ul>).
4. Each item in the list should be displayed as a list item (<li>) with a custom style.
5. The style should include a custom background color and font family.
6. The component should be reusable, so it should be easy to change the list of items and the custom style.


Bonus:
1. Add a hover effect to the list items that changes the background color.
2. Add a click event to the list items that logs the item to the console.
